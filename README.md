# My Final Project for FER
Physics based simulation of rigid bodies

The simulation is built in C++ using the OpenGL, GLFW and
GLM libraries for rendering and mathematical operations. The theoretical foundation covers
vector algebra, camera transformation matrices and the physical model of motion and
collision. Two types of collision detection and resolution are implemented — sphere-sphere
and sphere-static object — where the closest point on a triangle is determined using an
algorithm based on Voronoi regions from Ericson's Real-Time Collision Detection. Collision
resolution is based on conservation of momentum with an elasticity parameter. The user is
provided with interactive camera control and the ability to launch spheres into a scene
composed of static objects.
